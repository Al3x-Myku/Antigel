# Community Page - Complete Rework

I'm creating a completely new, beautiful community page with:

1. **Settings dropdown in corner** (Leave & Delete options)
2. **Blockchain task creation** using the deployed contracts
3. **Pretty UI with gradients and animations**
4. **All existing logic preserved**

The file will be too large to create in one go. Let me create it in the actual file now.
