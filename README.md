# SideQuests
Work in progress; could be used by small-medium communities like universities, companies, etc.

- We'll use the Ethereum blockchain for tokens (that can be converted for merch, or other items) & NFT Badges
- AI: Weighted GraphRag for finding `user` - `task` matches
- Users would need to describe their skills (for GraphRag)
- Perhaps, AI for the UI (search for tasks, give you ideas & tips, etc.)
